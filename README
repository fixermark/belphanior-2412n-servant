The Belphanior 2412n servant interfaces to a Smarthome 2412n SmartLinc controller
(http://www.smarthome.com/2412N/SmartLinc-INSTEON-Central-Controller/p.aspx). It can
be used to send commands directly to the controller to switch lights and appliances
on and off and control brightness and intensity.
